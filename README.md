## 📲 Design and layout infos

Designed for desktop, but is also mobile friendly

## 🔧 Development

### Requirements

Node.js and npm

### 👨‍💻 Install all dependencies

`npm install`

Since there is a postinstall, the system automatically searches the client folder and installs the required dependencies there, too.

### 📜 .env

There is an included .env.example file.

You need to have an API key for rawg.io and paste it to the env file if you want to experiment on your own.
